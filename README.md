# Module 13 Challenge: E-Commerce Backend
  ![License:MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) 

  ## Description
  
  I needed to create the backend for an ecommerce application.
  
  Using Sequelize, I created database models that were implemented into the E-commerce database using an Express server. I also created the CRUD Express routes to be able to view and manipulate the database's data. 
  
  For this challenge, we were given the inital file structure and were tasked with formatting the models and the routes. The inital schema is in the db folder, and the databse can be seeded using the seeder files in the "seeds" folder. (Those were also initally provided.)
  
  I used Insomnia to test all of the routes to ensure that CRUD functionality was working across the different routes. A demo video is included further below.
